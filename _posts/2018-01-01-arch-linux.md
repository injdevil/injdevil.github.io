title: Arch Linux
---

For most my life with computers I have used Linux. Windows was great but I decided to use Ubuntu. I tried out all sorts of Linux distros (ie. Elementary OS, Linux Mint, ) but none of them seemed right for me. After doing some searching around and I came to the conclusion that I had to attempt to use a minimal linux distro that is Arch Linux.

# About My Computer

_Hardware_: The PC I mainly use is a desktop that I built a few years back with a Intel Core i3, and 10 GB of RAM.

_Usage_: On my computer I mainly write code using a basic text-editor (i.e. vim or somethings for quick use nano) and browse the web.

# The Installation

Getting Arch Linux up and running on your computer really isn't that bad. Arch has great [documentation](https://www.archlinux.org/) and the [beginner's guide](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/beginners'_guide) makes everything very straight forward. It still took me few hours to get a stable desktop environment (it's very easy installation) once I got all the basic stuff taken care of I was finally able to begin making the operating system I really wanted.

# So Why use Arch?

I prefer Arch over other Linux distros or any operating system for that matter:

- All I needs is a terminal with some GUI
- The best performance
- I choose what's installed
- Always the latest software
- Installing software is easy with pacman
- Very intelligent community
- Teaches you about how Linux works

# Conclusion

I really do see myself sticking with Arch for quite some time. With its rolling releases there will be no need to ever have to install any major updates and I have everything I really need in a computer.

# What's on my PC

Here's a short list of things I have installed on my main Arch Linux computer.
